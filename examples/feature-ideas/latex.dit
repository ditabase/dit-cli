    \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for
    the \TeX{} typesetting program. It offers
    programmable desktop publishing features and
    extensive facilities for automating most
    aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing,
    including numbering and  cross-referencing,
    tables and figures, page layout,
    bibliographies, and much more. \LaTeX{} was
    originally written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport
    and has become the  dominant method for using
    \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
    The current version is \LaTeXe.

        E_0 &= mc^2 \\
        E &= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
    \end{align}
